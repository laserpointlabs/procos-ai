# ProcOS.ai - Process-Oriented Operating System

**Transform your decision-making with a Process-OS approach**

ProcOS.ai reimagines complex workflow orchestration through familiar operating system concepts, making advanced decision intelligence accessible to everyone.

## Vision

Just like your computer runs processes and threads, ProcOS.ai runs decision processes and thought threads - creating a living, learning platform where assistance is woven into every interaction.

## Architecture Concepts

- **Process Manager** → OS Process Scheduler
- **Thread Manager** → OS Thread Management  
- **Event Manager** → OS Event System
- **Context Manager** → OS Context Switching
- **Digital Assistance System (DAS)** → OS Kernel/Shell

## Development Status

Currently building the foundational website and platform. This evolves from our DADMS (Decision Analysis and Decision Management System) research and development.
