- `tutorials/` - Step-by-step tutorials
- `examples/` - Real-world examples

## DADMS Evolution

ProcOS.ai represents the evolution of DADMS (Decision Analysis and Decision Management System) into a process-oriented paradigm that mirrors how operating systems manage computational resources.

### Key Transformations

| DADMS Concept | ProcOS.ai Concept | OS Analogy |
|---------------|-------------------|------------|
| Project Service | Process Registry | Process Table |
| Thread Manager | Thread Scheduler | Thread Management |
| Event Manager | Event System | Interrupt Handling |
| Context Manager | Context Switch | CPU Context |
| DAS (Digital Assistance) | Kernel Services | OS Kernel |

## Process-OS Philosophy

Just as an operating system provides:
- **Process Management** - Creating, scheduling, terminating processes
- **Memory Management** - Allocating and managing system memory  
- **File Systems** - Organizing and accessing data
- **I/O Management** - Handling input/output operations
- **Security** - Access control and protection

ProcOS.ai provides:
- **Decision Process Management** - Orchestrating decision workflows
- **Knowledge Memory Management** - Organizing institutional knowledge
- **Information Systems** - Structuring decision-relevant data
- **Stakeholder I/O Management** - Managing human-AI collaboration
- **Governance Security** - Ensuring compliant decision-making

This familiar metaphor makes complex decision intelligence accessible to anyone who understands how computers work.
